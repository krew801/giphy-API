# giphy-API


The function of this homework is to utilize the GIPHY API and to build a page that will allow you to search for any Gif(the theme of my homeworkd is videogames)and to have 10 playable and pausable gif show up. I used Bootstrap for the layout, GIPHY API to build the app, and to get my Key, and HTML to display my code.

When you type a name into the search field and press "Submit", it will pull 10 gifs of what you typed, throw them on the page below, and it will create a button that you can click on later.
